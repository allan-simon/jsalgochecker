js algochecker
================

## Introduction
This project provide a simple webpage to check and compile a algorithm 

For the moment it only performs some very basic style checks, based on some very arbitrary rules
In the future it will eventually be extended to permit to fully compile and execute it in the browser (by compiling the algorithm into javascript, using certainly something like jison)
